# LoxLang

# Features
Lox is a simple yet powerful programming language that supports:

- Dynamic Typing: Variables can hold any type of value.
- First-Class Functions: Functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- Closures: Functions retain access to variables from their defining environment, even after that environment has gone out of scope.
- Object-Oriented Programming:
     - Classes and instances.
     - Inheritance for sharing behavior.
- Control Flow:
- if and else for conditional logic.
- while loops for iteration.
- for loops for concise iteration.
- Error Handling: Graceful error reporting and runtime exceptions.
